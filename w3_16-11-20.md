# WEEK 3 (16 Nov 2020)  

## Homework (from last week)  
### To research  

- **Besides typesettings, what else does typescript give you?**
[A rather extensive (but useful) Stackoverflow answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript/35048303#35048303)

- **Proptypes vs Typescript?**
Typescript and PropTypes serve different purposes. Typescript validates types at compile time, whereas PropTypes are checked at runtime.

Typescript is useful when you are writing code: it will warn you if you pass an argument of the wrong type to your React components, give you autocomplete for function calls, etc.

PropTypes are useful when you test how the components interact with external data.

- **Compile time vs runtime?**

Source code (if written in a high-level programming languages) must be compiled into machine code to be an executable program. The operations at compile time include syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. During compilation, errors can occur. They occur due to syntax and semantic errors.

The runtime is also known as execution time. It is the time when a program is running in contrast to other program lifecycle phases such as compile time, load time, etc.

When the compilation process is completed, it is run by the user. The time period to run the executable generated at compile time is referred as runtime. Runtime errors are known as exceptions.
