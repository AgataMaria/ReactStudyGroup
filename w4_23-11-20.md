# WEEK 4 (23 Nov 2020)  

## Homework (from last week)  
### To research  
- for Fatma research: Functional components over class components? Are Classes really ging away? What are the benefits / drawbacks, what do people use, what is the word on the street, what do we actually use?  
- for Ewa what are hooks then? Research, come up with a good description (interpretive dance)  
- for AK: check out React developer tools.  

### To read  
- Opinionated Guide: Pages 27-49 (chapter about project starters)  

## Questions  
- Elisabeth to explain cargo culting  
---

## Agenda (template)  
_free form, all in chaotic order (chaotic order, get it? :D)_
- go through the chunk of the Opinionated Guide to React we were assigned  
    - _explain how we feel about it_  
    - _examples, questions?_  
    - _note the cool stuff in [Takeaways](#Takeaways)_  
- go through [Questions](#Questions)  
- note anything that needs fact checking / researching for next week  
- AOB

## Takeaways  
:takeout_box:  
_In addition to contents of the book:_  
### **Project Starters**  
#### Gatsby  
Static site generator (HTML generated on build time).  
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) seems to be widely used, it's well supported and has good documentation  
- Easy to use for Marketing folks  
- There is a ton of templates to choose from  
- Has a lot of useful functionality and plugins  
- Batteries included and you can set the site up very quickly  
- Site builds can be slow, especially for large sites, HOWEVER:  
	- this is faster is you use Gatsby Cloud  
	- **traditional build** builds everything each time, but there is a beta for [**incremental builds**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-04-22-announcing-incremental-builds/), which would only rebuild the parts that have been updated.  
	- there is also a [**conditional builds**](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conditional-page-builds/) options (experimental)  
- Good not only for blogging :)  
- GraphQL - may seem like a bit of a learning curve, but as per Benedicte's advice - you can just use a **GraphQL Playground** when you need it and forget the whole thing  



**Useful PLUGINS - by Ladies of React**  
`gatsby-remark-oembed`  
[gatsby-remark-oembed](https://github.com/raae/gatsby-remark-oembed) is a GatsbyJS Remark Sub-Plugin transforms oEmbed links (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, CodePen etc.) into its corresponding embed code. **This auto-updates**, so you're not risking using old oEmbed code, after it changes at the source. WINNER! :sparkles:  
  
`[gatsby-image]`  
[Gatsby Image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-image/) takes care of... images. Does alternative sizes, lazy loading and all that stuff we care about.  
  
`gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`  
[Gatsby Plugin React Helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/?=)  lets you control your document head, important for SEO.  

* `NFL\React-Helmet`  
[React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) maintained by the NFL.  
  
`gatsby-plugin-mdx`  
[Gatsby Plugin MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) let's you combine JSX and MarkDown. :exploding_head:  

#### Next.js  
Looks powerful, especially if you do need [Server Side Renderring](About-SSR:)  
#### Create-react-app  
If you want to own the tooling of the app, perhaps not the best option.  
#### Others  
It seems the cool kids are also using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)  
Note: some teams would opt out of using starter's as they want to keep full control of the toolchain.  

### About SSR:  
SSR - HTML rendered when you ask for the page on the server and then sent to you. Opposite to Client Site Rendering, where turning JS off in your browser will mean you won't see the page (or maybe you will see something, but just a fallback _noscript_ option)  
It's the cupcake you get from your hipster bakery (or a local shop), and get home to put the sprinkles on yourself.  

### About hooks:  
React hooks aren't really hooks, but React doesn't really have an engine, so it aaaalmost makes sense why, what are essentially [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), are named hooks.   
A 'hook' is a way in which you can write code that doesn't have too much boilerplate and you don't have to instantiate anything, but it works.  
_useState_ is an example - there's some code, underneath of it is a closure, you can use some variables, functions call themselves for you. - _(AK's take on Ewa's words)_    

### About Cargo Culting:  
Religious groups that started popping up in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century - name came from an Island where after WW2 countries were dropping cargo for their armies, the islanders were eager to keep 'receiving the gifts' so they would perform rituals hoping for the goods. In tech - you can put stuff in your code that, you don't know what it does, but you put it there, because you're hoping it will do something... because you feel it maaay be useful. Cargo culting as a term can be used in many ways like _'Sooo... are we doing something here or just cargo culting?'_ - _(AK's take on Elisabeth's explanation)_  

### Useful:

## Homework (TO DO)  
### To research  
_from questions we wish we didn't ask_   
- if possible: think of questions CS students may ask Ewa, so she can prepare herself emotionally and have a politically correct answer  
- for Fatma (or someone else, because it's important) research: Functional components over class components? Are Classes really ging away? What are the benefits / drawbacks, what do people use, what is the word on the street, what do we actually use?  

### TO READ FOR NEXT WEEK  
_from the book_  
Skim pages 50-88 (Packages: Routing - Styles)  
Think: what do we use at work, what would we like to use at work, what's a pain - success stories and horror stories.
