# WEEK 5 (30 Nov 2020)  

## Homework (from last week)  
### To research  
_from questions we wish we didn't ask_   
- for Fatma (or anyone else :)) research: Functional components over class components? Are Classes really going away? What are the benefits / drawbacks, what do people use, what is the word on the street, what do _we_ actually use?  

### To read    
_from the book_  
Skim pages 50-141 (Packages)  
Think: what do we use at work, what would we like to use at work, what's a pain - success stories and horror stories.  

## Questions  
- :muscle: if possible: think of questions CS students may ask Ewa, so she can prepare herself emotionally and have a politically correct answer
