## Takeaways  
:takeout_box:   

### Adding keys to elements  
- generally JUST DO IT  
- the only times it would make sense to use index instead of a unique key  
	- something that never changes order  
	- static content that you will never be filtering  

### Keeping components small  
- if you have a bit of a functionality in the component then that's usually when you should start thinking about moving this part to it's own component  
- it's useful for checking performance, easier to investigate with React Dev Tools
- you can pass component as a child but also as a prop - it can be helpful to you create a layout component, which just receives components as props, the components take care of their own functionality and 
- dumb components are now more and more often referred to as render components  

### React.memo and `useCallback`  
- memo is useful in lists, but wouldn't used them all the time  
- useful, because let's say your parent component rerenders - it would rerender with all the functions, but if you use useCallback it remembers the function already, so don't need to recreate it  
- Eva wraps wraps pretty much all onClicks into useCallback, because  

### Mounting and umounting  
- don't mount and unmount especially gigantic SVGs :)  

### Virtualizing lists  
- [_react-virtuoso_](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso) does the same thing as [_react-window_](https://react-window.now.sh/#/examples/list/fixed-size) and [_react-virtualized_](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List)
