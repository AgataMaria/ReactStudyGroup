## Agenda (template)  
_free form, all in chaotic order (chaotic order, get it? :D)_  
- go through the chunk of the Opinionated Guide to React we were assigned  
    - _explain how we feel about it_  
    - _examples, questions?_  
    - _note the cool stuff in [Takeaways](#Takeaways)_  
- go through [Questions](#Questions)  
- note anything that needs fact checking / researching for next week  
- AOB

## Takeaways  
:takeout_box:   

### The rules for hooks:  
- Hooks only work for functional components  
- When creating your own naming the convention is to pre-fix them with 'use-'  
- Don't use hooks inside for loops, if statements etc.  

### Most useful ones:  
- `useState`  
\- used for state management  
\- returns an array - we would destructure useState to **two elements**,one would be the **state**, and the other one would be a **function that allows us to update the state**, by convention named prefixed with 'set-' - for example `[open, setOpen]`  

- `useEffect`  
\- always triggered on mount (unless told otherwise)  
\- would keep rerendering unless you pass a second parameter - and really, always always pass something - either an empty array or a dependency array  
\- empty array - will only render once (generally)  
\- dependency array - 'whenever one of these changes - then use the code inside useEffect' - you would add variables/dependencies and the component will re-render (run useEffect) whenever whatever is in the dependency array changes  
\- often called side effect code, so it's a side effect of something changing  
\- can be used to fetch things  
\- and used as an event listener  
\- it's important to think about cleaning up after useEffect (avoid memory leaks)  
\- good for fetching data, but  triggeting fetch _only when required_ - no use in fetching all the time, useEffect gives you more control over this  
  

### Other hooks and use cases  
- `useReducer`  
\- whatever you want to do with your state - you can bundle in a reducer action  
\- they make everything a lot more organised  
\- the logic used is the same as in Redux so it's good to learn this  
\- basically if you have more than 2-3 useStates and they all do something at all times - tidy it up with useReducer  
  

- `useRef`  
\- useful for referring to individual DOM element  
\- '[...] _they are there to hold references to things that are not supposed to make the component re-render. The ref may change, but it doesn't trigger a component rerender_' - the way Benedicte thinks about refs  
\- from Fabio 
\- can use for cache  


- `useMemo`    
\- checks if a computations has been done before and a value is available  
\- if you want to calculate something - you can check if perhaps it has already been calculated - if it has you can refer to it, otherwise you will be computing with every time you render the component (which with big calculations can mean a lot of waste)  
\- it will only run when one of the dependencies has changed  
  

- `useCallback`  
\- same idea as _useMemo_, but for funtions rather than pre-calculated values  
\- you can check if something is processing etc.  
\- it doesn't stop the execution of the function, but stops the creation of the function (less waste)  
\- if you use with an empty dependency array, it will only run once, which may be a good idea  
   
See this post on [useMemo vs useCallback](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/usememo-and-usecallback)  
  

- `useLayoutEffect`  
\- if you're asking for information from the DOM that's not available yet  
\- From Benedicte:  
> useLayoutEffect this runs synchronously immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations. This can be useful if you need to make DOM measurements (like getting the scroll position or other styles for an element) and then make DOM mutations or trigger a synchronous re-render by updating state.  
> useLayoutEffect runs synchronously after a render but before the screen is updated. That goes:
> - You cause a render somehow (change state, or the parent re-renders)  
> - React renders your component (calls it)  
> - useLayoutEffect runs, and React waits for it to finish  
> - The screen is visually updated  
\- Generally - you will use useEffect for most of the work, but if you get a flicker, consider your options ;)  
  
See this post on [useEffect vs useLayoutEffect](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/useeffect-vs-uselayouteffect)  
  

- `useContext`  
\- for state management that's global, if you don't want to be props drilling because only a few of your components actually need to know this - without going through all the layers  
\- think 'is user logged in?' / 'light theme / dark theme?'

## Homework (TO DO)  
### To research  
_from questions we wish we didn't ask_   
- EVERYONE: Think of questions you were always itching to ask, but never dared :)  
- Benedicte: send us that 'glue' wine recipe 🍷  

### TO READ FOR NEXT WEEK  
_from the book_  
- everything after Hooks :)

**BONUS (from outside the meeting):**  
From Fabio Rosado:  
> I hope this becomes useful [...] I had to create a video player. I was using a lot of `document.getElementById` to get the reference of the `<video>` tag. I was also adding a lot of `addEventListener` to the video reference.  
> Here's how I refactored my code - and also fixed some annoying bugs (the keyboard shortcuts didn't work unless you click/hover the player). Use useRef on the thing you want to get. For example:  

```
const videoRef = useRef()
<video ref={videoRef}>
```
> then you can use videoRef.current to do things that you would usually need to do with document.getElementById.  
> On the addEventListener inside useEffect you can probably use JSX attributes instead.  
> For example:  

```
// before
useEffect(() => {
  videoRef.current.addEventListener("pause", myFunction)
})

// after
<video onPause={() => myFunction()} />
```
